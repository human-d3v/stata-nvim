## Syntax

`sem paths` ... \[`, covariance() variance() means()`
`group(varname)`\]

`sem paths` ... \[`, covstructure() means() group(varname)`\]

`paths` specifies the direct paths between the variables of your model.

The model to be fit is fully described by `paths`, `covariance()`,
`variance()`, `covstructure()`, and `means()`.

The syntax of these elements is modified (generalized) when the
`group()` option is specified.
