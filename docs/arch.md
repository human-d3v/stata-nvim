To fit an ARCH(`#m`) model with Gaussian errors, type

`. arch depvar ..., arch(1/#m)`

To fit a GARCH(`#m,#k`) model assuming that the errors follow Student's
t distribution with 7 degrees of freedom, type

`. arch depvar ..., arch(1/#m) garch(1/#k)`
`distribution(t 7)`

You can also fit many other models.
