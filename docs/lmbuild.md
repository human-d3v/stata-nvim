## Syntax

`. lmbuild libname` \[`,` \[`new`\|`replace`\|`add`\] `dir(dirname)`
`size(#)`\]

`libname` is the name of a Mata library, such as **lexample.mlib**.
Library names must start with `l` and end in `.mlib`. Library names may
be specified with or without the extension.

`lmbuild` is a Stata command that you use from Stata's dot prompt, not
from Mata's colon prompt.
